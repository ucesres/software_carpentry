Farmer Brown

Old king cole was a merry old soul
A merry old soul was he
He called for a light in the middle of the night
To go to the WC
Now the WC was occupied, 
And so was the bathroom sink
But it had to be done, oh it HAD to be done,
So out of the window it went...
Now Farmer white was walking by
and heard a rumbling in the sky
As he looked up,
It came down
And now they call him Farmer Brown
